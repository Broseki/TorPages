# TorPages
Deepweb Static HTML/Text Hosting Server

TorPages allows a user to publish a static HTML/Text page to the deep web using Python and the Flask framework.

The goal of this project is to allow those that would normally be threatened if they created something like a blog, to publish their content without needing to know how to program/host an onion site on the Tor network.

This project is supported by CaveFox Telecommunications and is licensed under Kopimi (public domain).

You can see this project in action on the deep web  here --> http://m54wkp5ctdpummms.onion/
