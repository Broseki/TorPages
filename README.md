# TorPages
Deepweb Static HTML/Text Hosting Server

TorPages allows a user to publish a static HTML/Text page to the deep web using Python and the Flask framework.

The goal of this project is to allow those that would normally be threatened if they created something like a blog
the ability to create one without needing to know how to program/host an onion site on the Tor network.

This project is supported by CaveFox Telecommunications and is liscensed under Kopimi (public domain).
