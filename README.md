# TorPages
Deepweb Static HTML/Text Hosting Server

## Important
This project is not under development anymore, it was something I designed in high school, nearly 6 years ago, for fun over a winter break. I would not recommend using this other than as maybe a reference. I am going to leave it up because I think it was one of the more fun project I created when I was younger, but it is evident I wrote this before any formal education in computer science.

## About
TorPages allows a user to publish a static HTML/Text page to the deep web using Python and the Flask framework.

The goal of this project is to allow those that would normally be threatened if they created something like a blog, to publish their content without needing to know how to program/host an onion site on the Tor network.

This project is supported by The CaveFox Technology Corporation and is licensed under Kopimi (public domain).

CKEditor is used in this project - This was not created by contributors of this project - See http://ckeditor.com for that project.
